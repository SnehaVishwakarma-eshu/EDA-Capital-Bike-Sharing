# EDA-Capital-Bike-Sharing
Problem Statement : Capital Bike Sharing With environmental issues and health becoming trending topics, usage of bicycles as a mode of transportation has gained traction in recent years. To encourage bike usage, cities across the world have successfully rolled out bike sharing programs. Under such schemes, riders can rent bicycles using manual/automated kiosks spread across the city for defined periods. In most cases, riders can pick up bikes from one location and return them to any other designated place.  The bike sharing platforms from across the world are hotspots of all sorts of data, ranging from travel time, start and end location, demographics of riders, and so on. This data along with alternate sources of information such as weather, traffic, terrain, and so on makes it an attractive proposition for different research areas.The Capital Bike Sharing dataset contains information related to one such bike sharing program underway in Washington DC.
